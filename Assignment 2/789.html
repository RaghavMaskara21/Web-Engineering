        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a standard style sheet
        language used for describing the presentation (i.e. the layout and
        formatting) of the web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to CSS, nearly all of the presentational attributes of HTML
        documents were contained within the HTML markup (specifically inside the
        HTML tags); all the font colors, background styles, element alignments,
        borders and sizes had to be explicitly described within the HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, development of the large websites became a long and
        expensive process, since the style information were repeatedly added to
        every single page of the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve this problem CSS was introduced in 1996 by the World Wide Web
        Consortium (W3C), which also maintains its standard. CSS was designed to
        enable the separation of presentation and content. Now web designers can
        move the formatting information of the web pages to a separate style
        sheet which results in considerably simpler HTML markup, and better
        maintainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS3 is the latest version of the CSS specification. CSS3 adds several
        new styling features and improvements to enhance the web presentation
        capabilities.
